#Planetary Collisions in VPython#

The two programs below both model planets as collections of spheres and make them smash into one another.
Gravity, collision logic, and coefficient of restitution are all taken into account. The jupyter notebook
is an implementation using Numpy with vpython just for the graphics, but it doesn't work all that well.
The .py file is meant to be run in glowscript and works quite well.
